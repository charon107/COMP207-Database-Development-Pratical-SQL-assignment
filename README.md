# CS-Store-promotions
The	assignment	is	to	create	a	supermarket	database	for	a CS	Store	supermarket.	Most	of	the	tables	
are	what	you	would	expect	 from	 the	videos	on	SQL	 (with	a	similar,	but	not	always	identical	set	of	
attributes).	The	 twist	compared	 to	 the	slides	 (otherwise,	if	you	could	just	 follow	 the	slides	without	
thinking,	it	would	be	a	bit	too	easy)	is	that	we	will	also	want	to	support	promotions	ala	buy	one,	get	
one	free	or	buy	5	items, get	the	3 cheapest	free â€“ you	buy	some	items	of	a	type	and	get	some	of	the	
cheapest	ones	free.
